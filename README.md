# React Native Expo "Guess My Number Game" App

This is a simple React Native Expo application where the AI tries to guess the number you're thinking of, between 1 and 99. After each guess, the user provides feedback to the AI indicating whether its guess was too high, too low, or correct. The AI then responds accordingly until it correctly identifies the user's number.

## Features

- User-friendly interface
- Efficient number guessing logic
- Compatible with both Android and iOS

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusername/number-guesser-app.git
   cd number-guesser-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   Make sure you have the [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) installed globally.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the app**

   ```bash
   expo start
   ```

   This command starts a development server and opens up the Expo Go app in your default browser. You can now scan the QR code using the Expo Go app on your Android or iOS device to see the app live.

## Usage

1. Think of a number between 1 and 99.
2. The app will make a guess.
3. Provide feedback by pressing one of the buttons: "Too High", "Too Low", or "Correct".
4. The AI will adjust its guess based on your feedback and try again.
5. This continues until the AI successfully guesses your number.
